BONUS: The Proof Challenge – powered by zkVerify

Make AI computation verifiable and auditable

Design a mechanism to verify AI compute results (e.g. matrix ops or inference) using zero-knowledge proofs. Builders can use zkVerify’s SDK to create and validate SNARK circuits, linking verified compute to the Amadeus uPoW framework.

Goal: Make AI computation verifiable and auditable.
Deliverables: zk circuit + verifier demo or dashboard.
Value: Establishes Amadeus as a leader in verifiable AI compute.
