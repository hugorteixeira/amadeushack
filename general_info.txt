Build the Future of Autonomous Agents.

Amadeus Genesis Hack ·  6 weeks · $100K in prizes

Join the global Amadeus community for a hybrid soft + hard hackathon designed to shape the foundations of the world’s first thinking blockchain.

This is a no-code ideathon + compute challenge for creative minds ready to define the next era of onchain AI.


Why build on Amadeus?

🔮 AI-native infrastructure to power the autonomous economy, a blockchain that thinks, learns, and evolves.

🧠 Product Stack: NovaAI (agent training), Agent Studio (no-code UI and marketplace).

🤑 Tech Stack: x402, privacy layer, sub-second finality and massive TPS, settlement and coordination for agents.

📍Shape the Future of Decentralized AI - Your feedback and ideas directly influence the Amadeus roadmap. We're building the strongest AI builder community onchain and we're excited to build it with you.


Who should join:

For Entrepreneurs & Founders

The Soft Hack (Ideathon) is designed for you if you want to:

    Design an agent-driven application

    Explore tokenized agent economies

    Position yourself for funding + launchpad support in Q1

No code required.

For AI, ML & Hardware Engineers

The Hard Hack challenges you to:

    Build a high-performance MatMul solver

    Benchmark AI workloads

    Experiment with real hardware using Tenstorrent’s Blackhole™ p150a Tensix Processor


Tracks

Take your pick or participate in both. Learn more about each track requirement and deliverables in the categories tab.

1. Soft Hack — Ideation Track

Conceptualize and prototype AI agents or decentralized apps that could run on Amadeus — informed by upcoming roadmap primitives like:

    Onchain agent execution

    Verified compute

    AI training

    GPU marketplace

This track feeds directly into the Amadeus Launchpad pipeline.

2. Hard Hack — RISC-V Compute Track

Build a MatMul solver capable of running AMA-style compute workloads on Tenstorrent hardware. Cloud hardware instances are provided for all participants.


Prizes & Perks

    $100,000 prize pool, paid out in $AMA
