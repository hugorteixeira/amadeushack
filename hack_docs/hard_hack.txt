Hard Hack: RISC-V Edition

TensTorrent Blackhole™ p150a cloud access will be provided to all participants, free of charge.

Your goal is to demonstrate Tenstorrent hardware running decentralized AI workloads with verifiable performance.  Choose from the either challenge below:

Challenge A — Miner RISC-V Computer Prototype

Build a prototype MatMul solver capable of executing amadeus computer workloads (e.g., matrix multiplications).

Highest score wins, source code can be kept confidential to the team, you will be given an API to submit solutions to, quicker implementations wins. Build a prototype miner client capable of executing AMA compute workloads  inside a RISC-V environment.

Deliverable:

    Score Challenge: Submit benchmark results demonstrating performance on CPU/GPU-based RISC-V simulation.


Challenge B — Succinct Proof on RISC-V

Implement SPI proof computation that runs efficiently on RISC-V.

Deliverable:

    Fastest Merkle Proofs: Provide the fastest verifiable Merkle proof generation and verification running on RISC-V.
