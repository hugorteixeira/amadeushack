SOFT HACK — IDEATHON TRACK

The Soft Hack is a design + architecture challenge focused on imagining what can be built on Amadeus, either using today’s capabilities or anticipating future features like Nova Runtime.


Preferred Verticals

    DeFi trading agents

    Sensor/perception agents

    Risk evaluation agents

    Compliance/KYC logic agents

    Onchain AI marketplaces

    Swarm coordination frameworks


What NOT to propose

    Web2 apps with a forced AMA label

    CEX tokens or memecoins

    Irrelevant NFTs

    Pure frontends with no agent logic

    Forks of existing DeFi apps with no innovation

Your submission must include

    ✔ Concept Deck: Clear overview, problem/solution, use cases.
    ✔ Architecture Diagram: System components + data flow + agent roles.
    ✔ Prototype / Mockups: UI, diagrams, logic flows, or code.
    ✔ How Amadeus Is Used

Optional: include bonus challenge to conceptually implement verified compute or permanent storage via ZK Verify or Arweave. Refer to BONUS challenge section for more details and additional perks.


Submission Requirements

Your proposal must include:

    Concept Deck — problem, solution, and use cases

    Architecture Diagram — components, data flow, agent roles

    Prototype / Mockups — UI, logic flows, or code
    Tradeoffs & Feasibility — what works now vs. what depends on future roadmap.

    How Amadeus Is Used — integration with:

        uPoW (future)

        WASM runtime

        State proofs

        Agent identity/memory

        Oracle streams

        Swarm coordination

Optional: BONUS challenge using ZK Verify or Arweave for verified compute or permanent storage.


Evaluation Criteria

    Creativity & Novelty — originality and differentiation

    Technical Feasibility — can it be built today; are future assumptions valid?

    Implementation Specificity — clear architecture, data flows, and build plan

    Ecosystem Contribution — expands agent use cases, tooling, infra, or adoption

    Documentation Quality — clarity, structure, completeness

    Real-World Usefulness — solves an actual problem; credible usage path

    Solves an actual problem

    Has a plausible path to usage
